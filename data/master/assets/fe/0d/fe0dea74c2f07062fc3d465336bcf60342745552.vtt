00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.291
Hello.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.250
My name is Sam.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.333
I am the Saba virtual assistant,
and I will be your guide throughout this course.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:20.083
I have been designed to swiftly provide answers
to your most common questions.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.583
This includes information about your Saba account

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:23.875
and learning progress,

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.458
as well as ESDC’s Essential Training Curriculum!

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:29.000
As I am constantly evolving,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.041
more answers will be added to my repertory

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.708
to ensure I offer you an agile and inclusive support.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.916
You will be able to find me directly through Saba,
on your login page

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:42.000
of your Saba learning management system and on iService.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.166
Now that we have met,

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:49.708
let’s learn a little more about your role and responsibilities as a Saba Administrator and who can support you.
