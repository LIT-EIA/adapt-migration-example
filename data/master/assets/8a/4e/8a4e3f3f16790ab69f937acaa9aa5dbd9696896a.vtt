00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
To help you conceptualize, the different parts of the  

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
Saba Learning Management System could be represented as the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.670
elements of baking a cake. When you bake, you need different tools and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.980
ingredients based on what kind of cake you are making.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.980
The Course level is like your baking dish. Much like how a baking dish

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.680
will determine the size and shape of a cake or how long it takes to 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.980
bake, a Course determines the basic outline of the content such as

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.980
the title, description and how long it takes to deliver.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.280
In Saba, the Course level is also the interface to which all learners

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.580
are exposed. It is also where learners go to search for a course

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.580
or to register to a class and access a Saba learnerâ€™s profile. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.980
The Class level is like the cake itself. The batter 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.980
determines the flavour of the cake, and how many servings it makes.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.280
In Saba, the Class level determines details like delivery type,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.580
the language of delivery, and manage the registration (roster) list.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.580
Just as you can have a plain or decorated cake, the Class level 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.980
 is where the administrator may add more details like resources

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.980
such as learning content, tests or instructors and include

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.880
 feedback evaluations. Or, if you were creating a curriculum where 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.580
multiple courses are required, it would look like a tiered cake 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.580
where each tier represents a different course.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580
Once your cake has been served, or your class has been 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.980
delivered, there is always a clean-up phase. For a Saba administrator,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.980
this includes managing the roster attendance, marking a class

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.880
as delivered or cancelled and creating analytical reports 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.580
such as feedback results.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.580
Let's get back to Saba.
