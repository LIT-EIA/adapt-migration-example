00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.250
To help you conceptualize,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.791
the different parts of the Saba Learning Management System
could be represented as the elements of baking a cake.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:17.208
When you bake, you need different tools and ingredients based on what kind of cake you are making.

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.333
The Course level is like your baking dish.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:24.958
Much like how a baking dish will determine the size and shape of a cake or how long it takes to bake,

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:31.500
a Course determines the basic outline of the content such as the title, description and how long it takes to deliver.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.500
The Class level is like the cake itself.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.333
The batter determines the flavour of the cake,
and how many servings it makes.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.958
In Saba, the Class level determines details like delivery type,

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:47.666
the language of delivery, and manage the registration (roster) list.

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:53.000
Just as you can have a plain or decorated cake,
the Class level is where the administrator may add more details

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
like resources such as learning content, tests or instructors
and include feedback evaluations.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.916
Or, if you were creating a curriculum
where multiple courses are required,

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:07.375
it would look like a tiered cake
where each tier represents a different course.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:10.666
Once your cake has been served, or your class has been delivered,

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.166
there is always a clean-up phase.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.916
For a Saba administrator, this includes managing the roster attendance,

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:22.916
marking a class as delivered or cancelled
and creating analytical reports such as feedback results.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.125
Letâ€™s get back to Saba.
