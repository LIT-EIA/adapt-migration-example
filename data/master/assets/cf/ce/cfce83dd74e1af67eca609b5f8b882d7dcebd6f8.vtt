00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.100
Hello! My name is Sam. I am the Saba virtual assistant, 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.270
and I will be your guide throughout this course. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.670
I have been designed to swiftly provide answers to your most common questions. 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.980
This includes information about your Saba account and learning progress,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.980
as well as ESDC’s Essential Training Curriculum! 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.980
As I am constantly evolving, more questions will be added

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.980
to my repertory to ensure I offer you an agile and inclusive support.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.980
You will be able to find me directly through Saba, 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.980
on your login page of your Saba learning management system and on iService

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.580
Now that we have met, let's learn a little more about your role 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.580
and responsibilities as a Saba Administrator and who can support you.
