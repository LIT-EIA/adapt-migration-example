Hello! My name is Sam. I am the Saba virtual assistant, 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.270
and I will be your guide throughout this course. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.670
I have been designed to swiftly provide answers to your most common questions. 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.980
This includes information about your Saba account and learning progress,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.980
as well as ESDCâ€™s Essential Training Curriculum! 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.980
As I am constantly evolving, more questions will be added

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.980
to my repertory to ensure I offer you an agile and inclusive support.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.980
You will be able to find me directly through Saba, 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.980
on your login page of your Saba learning management system and on iService

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.580
Now that we have met, let's learn a little more about your role 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.580
and responsibilities as a Saba Administrator and who can support you.
