00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.541
Hello there!

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.750
I’m here to walk you through the steps of creating a virtual class,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.333
as this delivery type can be a bit more complex.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.416
Let’s dive in and explore the key information in the main tab!

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.833
On the Define Class page, add or review the following information:

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.541
In the Class Details section:

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:28.791
The “title” will automatically be inherited from the course,
this field cannot be modified at the class level.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:34.958
The “Class ID” field is system-generated,
it will only be saved once you select “Finish” at this page.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.708
The “Domain” field must remain as ESDC.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:41.375
The “Description” field is optional.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.000
You can use this field to provide additional details

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.708
about the class that are not covered in the course description.

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:50.500
For this example, I will type:

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.208
This session will be facilitated by the Saba team.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.083
The “Course Description” field is inherited from the course,

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.500
this field cannot be modified at the class level.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.458
In the Scheduling Details section:

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:08.958
Select the Start Date Icon to open the Calendar view
to select the Start Date of your class.

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.708
The End Date will be generated by the
Session Template you choose

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:16.083
once you select Finish at the end
of this page to save your information.

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:20.750
A pop-up window will open,
you must select the start date of the class.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.625
Once you have selected the date,
the pop-up window will close automatically,

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:29.125
and you will be back at the scheduling details section
to add more information.

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:33.000
Select the Session Template icon to open the window.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.541
Choose the desired Session Template by
selecting the radio button under the “Select” column.

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.541
Click the Select and Modify button to modify the time.

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.291
Select the number 1 under the “Session” column
to edit the time of the class.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:52.416
Modify the time, make sure to follow the
identified format and select Save.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:56.875
You will be brought back to the Edit
Scheduling Information pop-up window.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:01.750
Once you confirm that the time has been updated,
select the Finish button.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.458
A pop-up window will display with the following message:

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:11.166
“After modifying a Session Template, the changes cannot be viewed until the class is saved”.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.125
Select OK.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:17.708
Click the Location icon to set the time zone for Virtual deliveries.

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:21.875
This ensures learners see the correct class start and end times.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.166
In the “Name” field, type the letters “vir”

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:29.208
and then click Search to display a list of possible time zones.

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:32.000
Select the appropriate time zone.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.708
Once selected, you will be brought back
to the Scheduling Details section.

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:41.500
Click on the Pick language
Icon to open the Select Language pop-up window.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.791
Select the Search button to display the available language options.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:50.083
Please note that the language choices
are inherited from the course level.

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:55.000
If not added, return to the course level
and add them under the Policies tab.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.666
Select the language of the class.

00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:01.500
Once the language selected, the Select Language
pop-up window will close,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.250
and you will be brought back to the Scheduling Details section.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.583
You will now see all the information
added in your Scheduling Details section such as the:

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:20.708
Start date, Session Template,
Duration, Location and Language.
