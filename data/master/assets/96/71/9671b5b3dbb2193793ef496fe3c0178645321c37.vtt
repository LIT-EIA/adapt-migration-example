00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:04.809
From the Main menu,

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.196
select the Admin item to open the Administration Home page.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.688
To access a report, select Analytics from
the header in your Admin profile in Saba

00:00:13.688 --> 00:00:18.127
or select the Analytics Admin hyperlink in the middle of the page.

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:21.457
The reports are grouped by specific categories.

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:24.892
You will see them by selecting the drop-down menu.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:27.376
The options are as follows:

00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:37.841
All, Recently Viewed, Favorite, My Reports, Built-in Reports, Scheduled.

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:41.118
You can set a default category for your convenience by selecting

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:45.081
the “Set Default” hyperlink located to the right of the category.

00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:50.737
When you select a category, Analytics displays all available reports for that category.

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:55.863
Please note that if a category shows the number 0, no report will be displayed.

00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:59.351
I recommend setting “All” as your default option.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:05.376
You can also search by “Report Name” or “Description” in the search field next to the dropdown category field.

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:07.702
You can also enter a keyword in the search field,

00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:11.613
and the system will display all reports containing that keyword.

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:17.585
In this example, we want to view a class completion report,
so we will enter the keyword “class”.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:23.293
All reports containing the word “class” are now displayed, with the entered keyword highlighted.

00:01:23.293 --> 00:01:28.419
Once you have located the required report,
select the title to run the report.

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:32.806
Enter the required information requested in each mandatory field.

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:37.404
Each report has their own mandatory fields based on the type of report.

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:41.421
Mandatory fields are indicated by a red asterisk.

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.905
We will type the Class ID.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.807
Once the window appears on the screen,

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:50.564
select the radio button next to the class ID, as shown in the example.

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:52.678
You can select Run to execute the report

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:56.695
or you can also select Save and Run to save your selected filters.

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:00.183
The filtered report results will display; these filters will be applied

00:02:00.183 --> 00:02:04.887
next time you run the same report.  I will select Run.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:10.119
This action may take a few seconds
or minutes, depending on the size of the report.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.563
Use the scroll bar down and from left to right of the report window
to view more information.

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:20.002
Select the Show or hide column setting icon located on the left side and bottom of the page

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:25.076
or select the title of the column to modify the sorting order (ascending or descending).

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:28.458
Select the Export icon on the upper on the right side of the page,

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:32.633
it is represented by an underlined arrow pointing downwards.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:36.122
This will open the “Download Report” pop up window. 

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:41.460
Select the format desired for the report export (CSV, PDF or Excel).

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.627
I recommend using the Excel format,

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:46.745
as it allows you to filter through the columns.

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:51.607
Selecting the Data Only checkbox will extract the report without the header. 

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:55.095
Select Download to download a copy of the report.

00:02:55.095 --> 00:02:58.161
Once the file has been downloaded, a window will open saying

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:03.129
“XLSX file for Class Completion Subscription Report is now available”.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.145
The name will change depending on the report you selected.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.365
Select this sentence.

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:14.544
Select the Open file hyperlink in the “Downloads” window on the top
right of the screen. 

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:17.081
Depending on the language of your profile setup,

00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.622
you will see these terms in the language of your profile.

00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:24.322
Once your file is open, you can save it and close it.

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:32.778
In Saba, select the Back hyperlink on the top left side of the page
to come back to the Report list.
