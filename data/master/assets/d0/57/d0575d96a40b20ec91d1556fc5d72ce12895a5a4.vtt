Hello! My name is Sam. I am the Saba virtual assistant, 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.300
and I will be your guide throughout this course. 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.670
I have been designed to swiftly provide answers to your most common questions. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.980
This includes information about your Saba account and learning progress,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.980
as well as ESDCâ€™s Essential Training Curriculum! 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.680
As I am constantly evolving, more questions will be added

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.980
to my repertory to ensure I offer you an agile and inclusive support.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.980
You will be able to find me directly through Saba, 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.280
on your login page of your Saba learning management system and on iService

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.580
Now that we have met, let's learn a little more about your role 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.580
and responsibilities as a Saba Administrator and who can support you.
